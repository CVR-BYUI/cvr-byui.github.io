	<h1>How can I watch?</h1>
		<p>I would like to design a website that provides information on how to watch certain programming such as tv shows, movies, and sporting events. There are so many premium channels and streaming services around that it is hard to determine which ones to choose. The user would simply search the title of what they would like to view and the website would provide the services that offer it, pricing, platform availability, and customer reviews.</p>
		<p>My website would be free to use and would generate revenue through the use of ads. Another way to generate revenue would be partnering with streaming services to spotlight their services and content. I would also utilize SEO in order to be at the top of the search results when someone searches, "How can I watch...?"</p>
